# LIMTS
LIMTS is more than a scheduler!

This was a scheduling application written hastily over the course of a semester. It's buggy, has redundancies everywhere and is in need of some *serious* refactoring. It was also written with limited technologies so there are hack jobs strewn about everywhere. Nevertheless, work will be started on correcting these bugs in the near future and refactoring it to use more "modern" technologies.
